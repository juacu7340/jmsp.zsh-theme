# jmsp.zsh-theme
A zsh theme focused on simplicity and SSH usefullness.

I used many themes and came to like the lambda theme alot, however I SSH very much
and I have that theme on all my machines, and that makes it confusing to know just
by looking at the prompt in what machine I'm currently in. So I changed that theme,
and replaced the lambda symbol with the hostname, and now I still have a minimalistic
theme, plus I know in what machine I'm currently in.

The design matches the parameters for commands like rsync also, so I can just copy
the prompt and use as parameter for that. (assuming you have SSH configurations where
the hostnames match the hostnames in the configuration file :) )

Here is a preview of the theme in action:
